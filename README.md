- Artificial language learning experiments: assumptions, advantages & disadvantages 

- On Schleyerâ€™s roots: designing an artificial language 

- The procedure: designing and running an artificial language learning experiment 

 
### Afternoon session 

- From lab to net: introducing the fundamentals of online experimenting 

- What's possible: An online communication experiment

- Q&A 

## TO DO (before workshop)

- [Download zip archive](https://github.com/annieholtz/ALLWorkshop/raw/main/starter_kit.zip) with all necessary files to follow this workshop. Unpack the archive in a location where you can easily access it later.

<!-- - [Download jsPsych](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/releases/download/%40jspsych%2Fplugin-webgazer-validate%401.0.2/jspsych.zip) (will start immediate download) this will create a zip folder on your computer containing all the files you need to run jsPsych locally on your computer. -->

- Download a text/source code editor. For example [Atom](https://atom.io/) (which I will be using) or [Brackets](https://brackets.io/).
